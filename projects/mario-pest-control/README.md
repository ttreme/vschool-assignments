#Mario Pest Control
This Project is a static website with basic button that is linked to a js file. The project was used to get the hang of bootstrap, and implement some basic js. All of the numbers are calculated and different functions are run when you press the buttons.

The website is relatively responsive but could use additional work. I will be coming back to this to touch up.
